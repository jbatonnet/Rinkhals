## Find the IP address of your printer

There are 2 options to find your printer IP address. First, make sure the pritner is connected to your Wi-Fi following the on screen instruction or wizard.

### From your printer screen

On your printer touch screen, either:

- Go to Network, then LAN Mode
- Your IP should be shown here

Or:

- Go to Device Information, then Printer Information
- Your IP should be shown here


## To use Mainsail or Fluidd, the web interfaces

Open your browser to http://YOUR_PRINTER_IP to open the web interface (Mainsail by default).
From there you'll be able to control your printer.

Please refer to Mainsail documentation for more information: [https://docs.mainsail.xyz](https://docs.mainsail.xyz)


## To directly print from Orca or OctoApp

Rinkhals supports Orca and OctoApp out of the box. Just add your printer using its IP address.
Then, you should be able to directly upload or print from those software or other similar ones.
