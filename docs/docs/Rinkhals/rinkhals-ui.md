title: Rinkhals UI
---

Rinkhals includes a touch UI you can access from the Settings (gear icon) > Rinkhals.

During startup, Rinkhals replaces the Support option in the menu by the Rinkhals option (so you don't contact Anycubic support for something about Rinkhals).

From this view you can access the list of installed apps. By tapping the checkbox you can quickly enable & start or disable & stop apps.

By tapping the app name you will enter the app details view where you can individually Enable/Disable, Start/Stop, access the settings if the app exposes some, and access a QR code if the app requires some actions from the user (to login for example).
