Here are some aggregated answer I gave on Discord. If you want to now more, join the server and ask me!

Also, have a look at the other pages in the wiki, such as [File Structure - Kobra Startup Sequence](../Reverse engineering/file-structure.md#kobra-startup-sequence)


## Questions and Answers

### What if I want learn more? Klipper etc. I need to learn Python?

For Rinkhals itself you don't need Klipper, you'll need Linux in general (filesystem, shell scripts, ...), Docker for easy setup, Python for Moonraker, the UI and other tools
Depends on what you're interested in!

For Klipper you have two parts, Klippy in Python on the SBC / or GoKlipper in Go for Anycubic, and Klipper for the MCU in C / C++

### What would you recommend as topics for this kind of firmware structure? Or what topics / documentation would help understand how you built Rinkhals to work along side the stock firmware so well?

I'd say the basics of this project is a good understanding of the basics of Linux.
It's not only about pure dev, but about putting scripts and configuration together to build the system.

There are many different approaches to firmware dev, you could rebuild everything and flash your own images like you would download an .img for a Raspberry Pi for example.
For Rinkhals I decided to create an overlay because it's way safer, easier to build and it allows me to rely on existing software from Anycubic.

So have a look at [https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals/blob/master/files/3-rinkhals/start.sh](https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals/blob/master/files/3-rinkhals/start.sh), it uses mount heavily to "hide" the stock filesystem and overlay my own to add binaries, scripts and all.

I really think those printers are super interesting to dev on, be curious about how things are starting, why you hear a beep when you plug a USB drive in. For example for startup follow `/etc/init.d/rkS`, after many scripts it will lead you to understand how Rinkhals starts.
Look at the stock firmware images as well, it's interesting to see how they built that, and you will realize it's far from perfect!
Every time I ask myself such a question and I explore, I end up learning a ton about Linux and how I could modify things.

The dev part is useful to automate things, build some programs that were missing. For example I added a touch UI in Python, a system monitor in Go, and a lot of Shell script programming.

The last part is binary hacking, maybe the most complex but I use Ghidra and BinaryNinja to analyse Anycubic binaries and patch them to get the behavior I want.

And TBH I don't know much about Klipper, 3D printing in general, but it's interesting to dig into that and learn along the way.
Almost everything is now open/broken for our printers, have a look and try to understand, RTFM for weird linux commands, and ask for leads here, I'd be happy to provide pointers!
