### MQTT

Live connection to Anycubic public MQTT servers. Used for OTA updates, remote control using Anycubic apps.
Anycubic firmware is connecting to them when LAN mode is disabled. Rinkhals Installer uses them to detect new (not yet mirrored) updates.

- ssl://mqtt.anycubic.com:8883: Used for China
- ssl://mqtt-universe.anycubic.com:8883: Used globally

### NTP

NTP client for syncing time. It will check DHCP lease for an advertised NTP server, and if none is advertised will use pool.ntp.org.

- **123/UDP** to either:
  - A local NTP server advertised by DHCP from your router
  - pool.ntp.org

### DNS

DNS uses 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS) and 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) using standard port 53/UDP. It does not appear to support DoT or DoH. The stock firmware does not appear to use the DNS servers advertised by DHCP.

- **53/UDP**: To 1.1.1.1
- **53/UDP**: To 8.8.8.8
