Check this page to better understand what is Rinkhals and how it works: [How Does Rinkhals work?](how-does-Rinkhals-work.md)

## Any firmware installation + SWU tools
On the Kobra series of 3D printer, it's possible to sideload .swu files to install or execute things. For example, official updates are provided as .swu files, similar to Rinkhals and other firmwares.

1. Format a USB drive as FAT32 (partition table must be MBR, GPT won’t work)
2. Create a directory named `aGVscF9zb3Nf` (older versions use another name, not covered here)
3. Copy your .swu file as `update.swu` in the `aGVscF9zb3Nf` directory
4. Plug the USB drive in the printer
5. You should hear a beep, meaning the printer detected the update file and started the process
6. The rest depends on what you try to install, as described in sections below

## Stock firmware installation

- Download the stock firmware you want to install from this share: [https://rinkhals.meowcat285.com/](https://rinkhals.meowcat285.com/)
- Follow the installation steps above
- After a couple of minutes, you will hear 2 beeps and the printer will reboot with your chosen firmware

## Rinkhals installation

- Make sure your printer firmware is supported (as described on the home page and on the releases page)
- Download the version of Rinkhals you want to install from the [Releases](https://github.com/jbatonnet/Rinkhals/releases)
- Follow the installation steps above
- After about 20 seconds (the time for the printer to prepare the update), you will see a progress bar on the screen
    - If the progress bar turns green and you hear 2 beeps, the printer reboots and Rinkhals is installed
    - If the progress bar turns red and you ear 3 beeps, the installation failed but everything should still work as usual. You will then find more information in the `aGVscF9zb3Nf/install.log` file on the USB drive

## Special note for Kobra 2 Pro [Mainbord Trigorilla Spe B v1.0.x] with Firmware 3.1.4

There are a number of issues with stock firmware 3.1.4 on the Kobra 2 Pro. You will need to downgrade to firmware 3.1.2.3 in order to install Rinkhals.

Follow those steps to downgrade to 3.1.2.3:

- Download firmware from here: [https://rinkhals.meowcat285.com/](https://rinkhals.meowcat285.com/)
- Format a USB drive as FAT32 (using MBR, GPT won’t work)
- Create a directory named `update`
- Rename `K2P_3.1.2.3.swu` to `update.swu`
- Copy the `update.swu` file in the update directory
- Plug the USB drive in the printer
- Go to "About Machine" in the printer menu
- Click on the arrow next to the version number
- Confirm, wait for the installation to complete
- Then follow the Rinkhals installation steps listed above

## How to deal with Anycubic firmware updates

!!! warning

    First, make sure the latest version of Rinkhals supports the new firmware you want to install. If it's not supported, don't create issues or ask for ETAs as there are good chances I'm already working on it. If you want more information, you can join the Discord server on the home page and participate in testing.

For now, it's important to apply the official Anycubic update first, and then apply a compatible Rinkhals version.

In the future, Rinkhals might be able to directly apply system update and/or survive official updates.

See the following section for more information.

## How does Rinkhals work with official updates (stock OTA)?

When you install an official update, Rinkhals startup files will be overwritten and thus Rinkhals won't boot anymore.

In this case, you can reflash a Rinkhals version that supports your firmware version and it will start again. Your configuration will be kept.

If you update your printer firmware to a version that's not supported with Rinkhals, you can either:

- Wait for the new Rinkhals version to be released. Please do not open issues or ask for ETA, I'm working on my free time!
- Reinstall a supported version of your printer firmware and install a matching Rinkhals version
- Starting from 20250316_01, you can create a .enable-rinkhals file at the root of a USB drive, plug it and reboot your printer. It will force Rinkhals to start, but you might experience weird behavior or even worst as the version was not tested.
